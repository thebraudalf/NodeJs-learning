This repository is my learning journey of NodeJs.


# Node Js
### It's a Javascript runtime that extends its capability on server-side. It's build on Chrome's V8 Javascript Engine.

#### Node is a event driven, non-blocking IO Modal. This means its asynchronous, and doesn't block itself for one request(but immediately moves to the next request). This makes Node extraordinarly fast and efficient.
