# Data Modeling

### Data Modeling is the process of creating a simplified visual diagram of software system and its data elements, using text and symbols to represent the data and how its flows.
### This process helps in defining the structure of a database, including the data entities, their attributes, and the relationships between them.

### It is the first process of writing backend or using which database for storing data.

## We can use Object Data Modeling(ODM) libraries for modeling data for different databases.
